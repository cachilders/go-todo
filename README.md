# go-todo
Yet another todo list project for messing around with stuff (c/o Scotch.io)

The initial commit reflects a fairly by the numbers implementation of this Scotch tutorial:
https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-a-single-page-app-with-go-echo-and-vue.

Anything that comes after is just me horsing around.
